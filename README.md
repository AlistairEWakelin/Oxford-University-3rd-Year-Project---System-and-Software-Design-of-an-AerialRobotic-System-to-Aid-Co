# Oxford-University-3rd-Year-Project---System-and-Software-Design-of-an-AerialRobotic-System-to-Aid-Co
This repository is primarily to act as a centralised location view-able by examiners, to store and act as a record of my code relating to my third year university project. This code is provided as evidence of my work and not to be examined, as such the majority has not been written with intent for distribution and reads as poorly as you would expect.

If you just want to see what the project was about, checkout the .mp4 files as they are a nice bit of sensor data overlayed with realtime footage of the drone. They would actually make a great infographic for a PID lecture -- please feel free to message me and request to use it for this purpose.
